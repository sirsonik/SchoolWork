TopicB.cpp 

This program is designed to perform the following steps:
1) Ask the user for the name of an input file. If the file does not exist, it will ask for another file name.
2) The getInput function will read one line from the file into a string.
3) The HugeInteger will call the member function StringIn to check the string to see if all characters in the string are digits.
4) If there is a non-digit character in the string, it will return false to getInput. getInput will read a new line into a string.
5) If the string is all digits, the digits will be converted into integers for the HugeInteger's array.
6) The array size will be enlarged by the StringIn member function if the current array is too small.
7) the Resize member function will check the array for empty slots after the input number or leading zeroes and resize the array as necessary.
8) The HugeInteger's name, its size, and valued contained within will be displayed to the user.
9) Steps 2 through 8 will be repeated for a second HugeInteger that is referred to by its pointer.
10) The two HugeIntegers will be added and the sum placed into a third HugeInteger. The third HugeInteger is also formatted to show the correct value.
11) The third HugeInteger is displayed to the user.
12) The two HugeIntegers are checked to see if the first is larger than the second.
	a) if it is not, the user is told and subtraction is not completed.
	b) if it is, then the second HugeInteger is subtracted from the first. The difference is reformatted to show correctly.
13) The third HugeInteger is displayed to the user.
14) Comparisons are completed one the two initial HugeInteger numbers (==, !=, >, >=, <, <= in order).
15) The comparison being performed and wether it is true or false is displayed to the user.
16) Repeat steps 2 through 15 until there is no more data in the file to read.
