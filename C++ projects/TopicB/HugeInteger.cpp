Resize
Input: The HugeInteger Executing the function.

			and all actual values are transferred to this array, the Number array is deleted and resized to the
			correct length before being filled with the HugeInteger. Another loop is then executed to find the first non-zero digit.
			The size of the array minus the number of iterations completed gives the number of leading zeroes.
			However, if the entire array is checked and every digit is zero, the new array will be one digit.
			A new temporary array is created with the final size of the number. The huge integer without the leading zeroes is
			copied to the temporary array in order to delete the Number array, change the size to the final size, allocate the
			Number array in free store, and place the number back into the Number array. The temporary array is once again deleted.
