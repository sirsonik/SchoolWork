This program compiles and runs with no errors.
Extra credit 1 and 2 have also been added to the program.

TopicAII.cpp

This program is designed to perform the following steps:
1) Ask the user to input a number. Any real value will be accepted.
2) The value input by the user is checked to verify it is a number.
3) If it is not a number, the user is notified that their input is invalid and will be asked to input a number again. This will repeat as necessary.
4) The user is asked for a second number. When this number is verified, it is also checked to verify it is not zero.
5) The first number is divided into the second number and the result is stored.
6) The division and result are displayed.
7) the user is asked if they would like to repeat the program.*/
