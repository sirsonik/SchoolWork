compress member function

	values and any data that may be in the indecies is cleared. The digit to be packed is added to the appropriate compressed data slot by a bit mask in order to truncate the number of bits
	stored for the given value if it exceeds how many bits are allowed for that digit. All but the last value to be stored in the digit are bitwise shifted left in order to store the next digit.
	Once the appropriate number of digits are packed into a single value, the process is repeated until all data is processed.
