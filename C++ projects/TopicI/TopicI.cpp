TopicI.cpp

This program compiles and runs with no errors.
**The extra credit requirement has been completed as well.**

1. All of the functioning portion of main is within a try block to catch any errors.
2. The file "TopicIinExtra.txt" is coded as the only file to open. If it cannot be opened, the function throws an error and the program terminates.
3. The first set of data is read from the file. If data is missing, one portion has an inconsistent format, or any type of problem is encountered with the data, the function
	throws an error and the program ends.
4. If the data set is processed correctly, the formatting data is also extracted.
5. The base data is displayed to the user.
6. The packer class is called and the data is compressed from the initial digits to one bit-packed digit per set, represented as an unsigned short integer.
7. The bit-packed data is displayed to the user.
8. The bit-packed data is written to a binary file named "TopicIBin.dat"
9. The array for holding bit-packed data is erased, the binary file is read, and the data saved in the array.
10. The bit-packed data is displayed to the user.
11. The data in the uncompressed data array is erased and the bit-packed data is extracted with a series of bit masks and bit shifts.
12. The uncompressed data is displayed to the user.
13. This process repeats until the flag states that the end of the file has been found.
14. The program ends.
