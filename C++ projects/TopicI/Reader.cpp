process member function
Input: ifstream object by reference, vector for holding read digits
Execution: The STATE is set to NOT_READY. The prep_set member function is called. If the prep_set returns a STATE of READY, the function can continue.
	Each line is read until a line containing a single asterisk "*" is processed. When this occurrs, the STATE flag is changed to SET_END.
	Until this, a "/" character is appended to the number for format purposes. An iterator and loop is uses to count the number of / characters in the holder since one should follow each number.
	If the number of /'s does not correspond to how many digits are supposed to be in a set, an exception is thrown. While this occurrs, the / are changed to spaces. This string of data is then
	appended to the ostringstream object. Once all data for the set has been read and verified to be correctly formatted, it is then placed into an istringstream object. The individual values
	are read one at a time into a vector that has been sized to the number of digits processed. If this has been completed successfully, then a STATE of SET_END is returned.
