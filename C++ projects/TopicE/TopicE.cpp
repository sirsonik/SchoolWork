The extra credit assignment of creating a vector of two Shape pointer arrays was completed.
This program compiles and runs with no errors.

This program does the following steps
1) Instantiates one each of the specified shapes - circle, square, sphere, cube, triangle, and tertahedron
2) Each shape as it uses its class constructor sets a name for its shape along with calculating and saving
	its area or surface area and volume.
3) A vector array is created with two pointers to pointers to shape (base class) objects.
4) Each of the pointers is assigned an array of six pointers to shape (base class) objects.
5) The addresses of the six shapes are given to the two arrays of pointers in the speficied orders.
6) All of the shapes have their information displayed.
7) The pointer arrays are deleted from the heap
8) Program end.
