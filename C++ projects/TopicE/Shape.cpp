Shape constructor
Input: Three doubles
Execution: The number input for the side value is checked to verify that it is positive. If not, it is made positive.
			The values are then placed into the corresponding variables. If a value was not passed,
			the default value (0.0) is saved. The shape is also given the name "Unnamed shape". However,
			since a Shape object will never be instantiated on its own, this value will be overwritten.
Output: One new shape object
