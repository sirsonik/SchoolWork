This program compiles and runs with no errors.

TopicC.cpp 

This program is designed to perform the following steps:
1) The first HugeInteger and the pointer for the second HugeInteger are created.
2) The first HugeInteger is filled with a test number and the third HugeInteger is created with the same values as
	the first HugeInteger. The values stored by the first and third HugeIntegers are displayed.
3)Ask the user for the name of an input file. If the file does not exist, it will ask for another file name.
4) The getInput function will read one line from the file into a string.
5) The HugeInteger will call the member function StringIn to check the string to see if all characters in the string are digits.
6) If there is a non-digit character in the string, it will return false to getInput. getInput will read a new line into a string.
7) If the string is all digits, the digits will be converted into integers for the HugeInteger's array.
8) The array size will be enlarged by the StringIn member function if the current array is too small.
9) the Resize member function will check the array for empty slots after the input number or leading zeroes and resize the array as necessary.
10) The HugeInteger's name, its size, and valued contained within will be displayed to the user.
11) Steps 2 through 8 will be repeated for a second HugeInteger that is referred to by its pointer.
12) The two HugeIntegers will be added and the sum placed into a third HugeInteger.
13) The third HugeInteger is displayed to the user.
14) The two HugeIntegers are checked to see if the first is larger than the second.
	a) if it is not, the user is told and subtraction is not completed.
	b) if it is, then the second HugeInteger is subtracted from the first and saved in the third HugeInteger
15) The third HugeInteger is displayed to the user.
16) Comparisons are completed on the two initial HugeInteger numbers (==, !=, >, >=, <, <= in order).
	a) The comparison being performed and wether it is true or false is displayed to the user.
17) Repeat steps 2 through 15 until there is no more data in the file to read.
